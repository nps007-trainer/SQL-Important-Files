full stack software engineering -- TERM2
mODULAR STUDENTS  :- TSQL 
RDBMS :- Relational Database Management System
PAMS :- PRODUCTION APPLICATION AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT

DATA :- COLLECTION OF RAW FACTS AND FIGURES. (YOUR PHONE NUMBER)
DATABASE :- COLLECTION OF INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF OBJECTS. (WHATSAPP GROUP)
		SKYPE GROUP..
WHY DATA IS REQUIRED , WHY TO STORE THE DATA :- WE NEED TO FETCH ANY OF THE RECORD FROM THE COLLECTION OF RECORDS.


DBMS :- Database Manageement System. It is a tool for organizing the data.

Database Objects :- Tables, Views, Stored procedure, functions, triggers, .....



SMARTPHONE :- DATABASE 
		COLLECTION OF OBJECTS
			CONTACTS, WHATSAPP, HIKE, FB.....
		SYNC :- STORAGE OF DATA ON OTHER SERVER END (BACKUP)
TOOL USED FOR STORING THE DATA IS ANY RDBMS APPLICATION.

MS SQLSERVER, ORACLE, SYBASE, DBASE, MYSQL.....

MS SQLServer IS A RDBMS APPLICATION FOR STORING THE DATA AND WORKING ON THE DATA .

Categories 
DQL :- Data Query Language  (Select   :-  query )
DML :- Data manipulation Language (Insert, Update, delete) / action queries
DDL :- Data Definition Language (Create, Alter, Truncate and Drop)
DCL :- Data Control Language (commit, rollback)


-------------- Nandini Contact is already saved 
		
			Add anothre number , add my email id and also add 					event

1. Modify the structure by adding all the above fields
		Alter statement
2. Add the values in the new fields
		 Update 

3. Ask to permanently delete my record
	Delete  :- deleting a record
4. Drop :- to remove or delete an object (complete structure with the data)

Truncate :- is similar to delete but truncate , deletes or removes all the records from a table without impacting the structure
		there is no chance of revert.
 
Delete :- deltes the specified record as per user's requirements 
		can be recovered



SQL :- Structured Query Language.
Contact app :- 1. created a new contact
Operations after contact gets created
1. Retrieving -- sending message
2. Deleting 
3. Modifying -- name , number , emailid, or you want to add certain other parameters.

--Operations like
1. Createing a contact, Retrieving the information, Modifying (Delete and Update)

Why WE ARE LEARNING SQL SERVER?
	STORING, RETRIEVING, UPDATING,DELETING,CONNECTING....
	HELPS AS A BACK-END FOR DATABASE APPLICATIONS, OR DATABASE WEB APPLICATIONS.
	WHATSAPP , SKYPE , FB, GMAIL, ECOMMERCE.

DATABASE IS A COLLECTION OF INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF OBJECTS.
	OBJECTS  :- TABLES, VIEWS, STORED PROCEDURES, TRIGGERS, INDEXES, FUNCTIONS,....

TABLE :- IS COLLECTION OF ROWS AND COLUMNS.

TERMINOLOGY IN RDBMS
TABLE		ENTITY / RELATION
ROWS		TUPLES / RECORDS
COLUMNS	ATTRIBUTES / FIELDS

AS PER OUR EXAMPLE

TABLE / ENTITY			STUDENT 
FIELDS / ATTRIBUTES			**STUDENTID, STUDENTNAME,MARKS,AGE,ROLLNO
							**  --   UNIQUE COLUMN -- NO DUPLICATE VALUES IN THIS COLUMN
				COURSE
					**COURSEID , ***STUDENTID , COURSENAME, FEES, COURSEDURATION
							** COURSEID -- UNIQUE COLUMN - EVERY COURSE WILL HAVE UNIQUE COURSEID
							*** STUDENTID -- ONE STUDENT CAN ENROLL FOR MULTIPLE COURSES.

		


================================= TASK 1
			UNDERSTANDING ER MODELING YOU TO SHARE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES ON ER MODELING.
			AND WHO INVENTED ER MODELING.


IF YOUR ENTITY CONTAINS MULTIPLE NON-RELEVANT ATTRIBUTES / COLUMNS THEN 						
IT WILL LEAD TO DATA REDUNDANCY (DUPLICATION)						
IT WILL LEAD TO DATA INCONSISTENCY.						
THE COLUMNS OF A TABLE ARE NOT ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER						
						
BREAKING DOWN THE COMPLEX DATA STRUCTURE INTO SIMPLER SMALLER TABLES IS CALLED AS 						
	NORMALIZATION.					

1NF -  FIRST NORMAL FORM 
	EVERY CELL MUST CONTAIN PRECISELY ONLY ONE VALUE IN IT.
2NF - SECOND NORMAL FORM
	EVERY COLUMN MUST BE DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER
3NF - THIRD NORMAL FORM
	EVERY NON-KEY MUST BE DEPENDENT ON WHOLE KEY NOT JUST THE PART OF THE KEY.

======================================= TASK 2
	
	NORMALIZATION AND DENORMALIZATION

======================================== TASK 3

	BCNF :- BOYCCODE NORMAL FORM.
