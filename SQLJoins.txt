Joins
To join more than one tables for retrieving data based on a common column.

foreign key :- checks the reference of primary record in a primary table.
Types of joins
1. inner join :- retrieves the matching records from the multiple tables based on a common column.

inner join							equi join
select s.studentid,name,bookname				*
from Student s join Library l					join
on s.StudentId=l.StudentId					=
Records of all the students along with their book details
2. outer join :- retrieves data from more than one table whether matching or non matching records based on position of a table

	1. Left outer join :- all records from LHS and matching records only from right table
	2. Right outer join :- all records from RHS and matching records only from left table
	3. full outer join  :- whether matching or non-matching from both the entities.

select s.studentid,name,bookname
from Student s left outer join Library l
on s.StudentId=l.StudentId
retrieves all the records from lhs table and matching records only from rhs table
select s.studentid,name,bookname
from Student s right outer join Library l
on s.StudentId=l.StudentId
select s.studentid,name,bookname
from Student s full outer join Library l
on s.StudentId=l.StudentId
3. Self join :- A table join with itself.  A multiple instances of a same table will be used, using different alias name
No need to use On keyword -- no any join type is used here
Manager is also an employee.
-----------Retrieve
the employeeid its managerid - title 
and title of managerid
-----------select emp.EmployeeId, emp.Title 'Employee Designation' ,emp.ManagerID, mgr.Title  'Manager Designation'
from HumanResources.Employee emp,
HumanResources.Employee mgr
where emp.managerid=mgr.employeeid
----------4. Cross join :- Cartesian Product , it retrieves all possible combination of records from specified entities.
select Colorname,Shapename
from Color,Shape
-----5. Equi Join :- is same as inner join it works only with equality operator used to retrieve matching records only from the specified tables. It retrieves complete column data.

Common column is movieid
output of inner and equi join
Movie id :- 1,1,2

output of left outer join 
lhs -- movies table
movie id :- 1 1 2 3
first name 3 --- null

output of right outer join
rhs -- actors table
1 1 2 5
